# LeetCode Java Practice

Daily LeetCode practice in **Java**, focusing on strengthening data structures & algorithms fundamentals.  
Goal: **2 Easy problems per day**, building consistency and sharpening logical reasoning.

---

## 📌 Rules

- Solve **2 problems per active day** (see schedule below).
- **Only Java** solutions in this repository.
- Each accepted submission will be automatically synced using **LeetSync / LeetHub**.
- Prefer clean, readable code over clever one-liners.
- If a problem takes **>25 minutes**, check hints or restart with a simpler approach.
- Avoid skipping topics — follow the structure.

## 📚 Topic Roadmap

| Stage | Topics |
|-------|--------|
| 🔹 Stage 1 | Arrays, Hashing, Strings |
| 🔹 Stage 2 | Two Pointers, Stack, Linked List |
| 🔹 Stage 3 | Binary Search, Math |

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **Java 17+**
- IDE: *LeetCode Editor / VS Code / IntelliJ (optional locally)*
- **LeetSync** (auto-commit from LeetCode to GitHub)
- GitHub for tracking progress & history

---

## 🚀 Long-Term Goal

By prioritizing consistency and revisiting weak areas, the outcome will be:

- Strong intuition in Big-O tradeoffs
- Faster ability to reason about unseen problems
- Interview-ready fluency in Java problem-solving patterns

## 🧠 Notes to Future Self

- It’s okay to struggle — progress = repetition + time.
- Write brute force first if stuck, then optimize.
- Commit **accepted solutions only** (not drafts).
- Review starred ⭐ problems at the end of each week.
